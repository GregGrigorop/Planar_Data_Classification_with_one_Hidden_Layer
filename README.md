# Planar_Data_Classification_with_one_Hidden_Layer

This repo presents my own implementation for a neural network with one hidden layer (a shallow neural net) from Coursera's "Deep Learning Specialization". For this project I generated red and blue points to form a flower and then fit a 2-class classification neural network to correctly classify the points. The first step was to to build all the necessary helper functions so as to implement a full model with one hidden layer more easily.

In the context of this project we can see units with a non-linear activation function (such as tanh), back-propagation being applied to data and we can also realise the effect that more hidden layers can have, as they can capture more complex structures.
